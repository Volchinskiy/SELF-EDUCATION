I don't want to think about it at all. I don't recommend this book to you. I want to stop working here because I feel that 
I don't develop in this place and I can do much more. I don't want to continue doing it. They don't help me at all. I 
recommend this channel to my friends. They don't want to change anything. We don't understand why she always says it.
I don't recommend these resources. I don't train so often but I perfectly understand that It's such an important thing 
to train regularly if I really want to achieve my aim. They don't try to change anything in their life. My acquaintances 
often have another opinion. I see you don't like it. You don't realize the importance of this thing. They don't want 
to think about it right now. My acquaintances don't understand why I do it. I perfectly realize the importance 
of these things but they don't see it. I often recommend this course to my acquaintances. I don't know why it happens.
I see you want to live in another place and I perfectly understand you. I don't worry about these things at all. 
I don't agree with it. I have another opinion. They don't have this experience. They don't recommend this course to 
us. I don't think it really works. This method seems so ineffective. I don't want to continue working here. I want to 
develop in another area. We don't want to waste time because time flies and we can't turn it back.
